    <p class="px-3">Honestly speaking there really is no such thing as a perfect mother. To be perfect denotes an essence of flawlessness in all areas with excellent skills. When one is perfect, there is no room for growth or advancement. Therefore, the children will suffer when you try to be the "perfect" mom. The reason being that you show your kids that perfection is only through your own behaviors and beliefs and anything less is failure. </p>

        Of course, Ethiopian babies and kids need to learn through examples from their parents but part of the main journey of growth is to extract experience through trial and error. The children are not the only ones to grow, the mother also gains knowledge and wisdom along that beautiful road of child-raising. The following are 10 ways to be the best Ethiopian mom or the best imperfect mother in Ethiopia:

        <article><h1> #1. Make sure to take good care of yourself</h1></article>
        <p>One of the best offerings you as an Ethiopian mother of a baby can give your family is to take care of yourself; your body, mind, spirit and feelings. </p>
        <article><h1>#2. Show yourself acceptance and unconditional love</h1></article>
        <p>Mothers of Ethiopian babies are exceptional at being able to love their children unconditionally. But, many forget to also give themselves unconditionally love. Ethiopian moms need to stop with the critical voice in their minds...always criticizing yourself, judging your efforts, and putting yourself down. Kill the critic and amplify positive self-talk, which will lead to a happy home, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.</p>
        <article><h1>#3. Remind yourself that being a mom is a life-long job</h1></article>
        <p>

            In the duration of a lifetime, your Ethiopian kid will belong to a plethora of relationships. But do not forget the bond a mother has to her child is definitely the most important relationship the child will ever own. Remind yourself that as an Ethiopian mother you have just been hired to do a lifelong job of guiding, nurturing, caring for, teaching, supporting and most important of all...loving.</p>

        <article><h1>#4. Find a life that is separate from that of your kids</h1></article>
        <p>Your Ethiopian kid will require your services in varied forms throughout its life. Ethiopian babies will need their mom to always be at their beck and call, meaning it needs immediate attention from food to diaper change to holding. But as the Ethiopian kid grows its needs evolve, therefore being available is crucial, but so is having a separate life from your child, with interests, hobbies, friends, and activities. </p>
        <article><h1>#5. Realize that we all make mistakes and apologies are not to be feared</h1></article>
        <p>Do not over do the "sorry", for every situation in which you assert yourself, instead realize that when you make a mistake, which we all do at some point in our lives, learn the skill of apologizing sincerely. It can be losing your temper or forgetting to do something, but if it has a negative impact on your Ethiopian baby or kid then, you have to apologize.</p>

        <article><h1>#6. Listen to your child</h1></article>
        <p>The feedback or comments both verbal and n0n-verbal are critical when it comes to being the best mother you can. Focus your attention on them and listen, even though you might not see eye to eye, it is nevertheless of critical importance in developing their thoughts and self-confidence. </p>

        <article><h1>#7. Busy as you may be, give them quality time </h1></article>
        <p>In this day and age, mothers are busier than ever before, but your kid needs a regular and routine form of quality time. Be sure to prioritize this, and be curious, ask them questions. </p>
        <article><h1>#8. If your child acts out, don't take it as a personal attack</h1></article>
        <p>As your kid grows, their independence will cause more quarrelling between the two of you. The direction you want them to go versus the direction they choose to go will be a source of constant conflict. When you feel frustrated, step back and analyze what they are trying to communicate and do not take it personally, it is just a normal part of their development. </p>

        <article><h1>#9. Healthy mood management</h1></article>
        <p>

            As an Ethiopian mother, you will have bad days as is common with everyone in the world, but the way you act with your child could lead to a positive or negative lesson. Being vocal and letting your kid know, in the form of, "mommy is having a bad day today, that is why I am being quiet, I just wanted to let you know yene konjo" could teach your child healthy mood management. </p>

        <article><h1>#10. Permit your kid to be themselves</h1></article>
        <p>Ethiopian mothers of babies and/or kids love to influence and shape their children...but kids usually already know who they are and what they want be. The secret is to find the perfect or imperfect balance between influencing/encouraging and independence/exposure. Love your sweeties but let them be who they are... </p>
